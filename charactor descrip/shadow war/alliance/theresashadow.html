                <p><span class="highlight">Theresa</span>, the matriarch of the Shadows, is both a symbol of hope and a testament to the cost of leadership. Her ability to create duplicates of herself—each as strong and determined as the original—makes her an unparalleled force on the battlefield. Leading her scythe-wielding jump troops from the skies, she strikes with precision and devastating power, embodying both the resilience of humanity and the weight of its struggle. Yet, for all her strength, Theresa is more than a warrior—she is a leader who carries the impossible burden of holding together a fractured world.</p>

                <p>Theresa’s troops see her as an unshakable beacon, her calm presence and encouraging words inspiring them to fight against overwhelming odds. But behind her composed exterior lies a woman haunted by the decisions she has made and the lives she has lost. Each victory comes at a price, and each sacrifice carves deeper scars into her soul. She fights not out of ambition, but because she cannot bear to see the world fall to despair. Her strength lies not just in her powers, but in her humanity—her ability to hold onto compassion even as the war threatens to strip it away.</p>
                
                <p>Theresa’s abilities are a reflection of her dual nature as both protector and warrior:</p>
                
                <ul>
                    <li><span class="highlight">Echo Duplicates</span>: Theresa can create perfect duplicates of herself, each capable of acting independently while retaining her full strength and skill. These duplicates allow her to be everywhere at once, overwhelming her enemies with precision strikes or shielding allies from harm.</li>
                    <li><span class="highlight">Aether Scythe</span>: Wielding a weapon infused with ethereal energy, Theresa’s scythe cuts through shadow and steel alike. Its strikes are imbued with restorative energy, healing allies while carving through enemies.</li>
                    <li><span class="highlight">Wings of Defiance</span>: Theresa’s ability to leap great distances or glide through the air gives her unmatched mobility. She can strike from above with devastating force or swoop in to rescue allies in peril.</li>
                    <li><span class="highlight">Unity’s Mantle</span>: Theresa projects a radiant aura that bolsters the morale and strength of her allies, imbuing them with her unyielding resolve. This aura shields them from fear and amplifies their fighting spirit.</li>
                    <li><span class="highlight">Oblivion</span>: Theresa’s ultimate spell, she locks people into their happiest memories, forcing them to relive the emotions they felt during that time. While entranced, her enemies are immobilized and vulnerable, their minds unable to distinguish the illusion from reality. It is a power both devastating and deeply humane, offering a glimpse of peace even in battle.</li>
                    <li><span class="highlight">Last Stand</span>: When pressed to her limits, Theresa channels all her power into a single moment of brilliance. Her duplicates merge into a unified form, unleashing a wave of energy that devastates enemies and revitalizes her allies, though it leaves her physically drained.</li>
                </ul>
                
                <p>As the counterpart to <span class="highlight">Darkness</span>, Theresa represents everything he has abandoned: empathy, hope, and the belief that humanity’s flaws do not define its worth. Their conflict is deeply personal, rooted in shared ideals that diverged into opposing paths. Where Darkness seeks to impose order through destruction, Theresa fights for a future where humanity can grow on its own terms, even if it means enduring pain and imperfection. Their battles are not just clashes of power but confrontations of belief, each one forcing her to question the cost of her cause.</p>
                
                <p>The <span class="highlight">Shadow War</span> leaves her victorious, but it is a hollow triumph. Though she breaks Darkness’s forces, the cost is nearly unbearable. Her allies lie decimated, the world left in ruins, and the people she fought to protect look to her with equal parts hope and grief. The weight of her pyrrhic victory is crushing—she has saved the world, but at the expense of nearly everything she holds dear. In the quiet aftermath, she wonders if the cost was too great, if her choices truly led to something better or if they only prolonged the inevitable.</p>
                
                <p>Theresa’s story is one of sacrifice, resilience, and the crushing burden of leadership. She is a hero, but not a flawless one. Her doubts, her grief, and her humanity make her relatable—a figure who embodies the strength to endure when hope feels like a distant memory. Her journey is not about glory but about survival, about finding meaning in the struggle and refusing to let despair take root, even when the world feels irreparably broken.</p>
                
                <p>In the end, Theresa is a reflection of the best and worst of humanity: flawed, determined, compassionate, and enduring. Her battle with Darkness is not just a war for the future but a tragic reminder of what is lost when ideals clash and the cost of fighting becomes unbearable. She is a leader who carries the scars of her choices, yet continues forward, believing—desperately—that even the smallest flicker of hope is worth saving.</p>
