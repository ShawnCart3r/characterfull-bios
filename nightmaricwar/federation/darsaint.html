              In the aftermath of <span class="highlight">Darkness’s</span> ultimate sacrifice, the galaxy teeters on the brink of annihilation. Persephone’s relentless forces, armed with the nightmaric virus, ravage entire worlds, spreading chaos and despair. The Shadows, once a united force under Darkness’s command, are fractured and leaderless, their hope fading with the loss of their patriarch. <span class="highlight">Theresa</span>, the nurturing matriarch of the Shadows, now bears the weight of their survival. Grief-stricken and infused with the lingering essence of Darkness, she rises as <span class="highlight">The Dark Saint</span>, a figure of cold fury and unrelenting resolve.</p> <p>Where Darkness fought with cunning and calculation, Theresa embodies a raw, visceral power fueled by sorrow and vengeance. Every strike of her reforged scythe carries the echoes of her pain, an unyielding reminder of the cost of survival. Guided by Darkness’s final lesson—“I don’t have to win; we just can’t lose”—she wages a lonely war against Persephone’s forces. Her wrath becomes legend, her presence alone a reckoning that ripples across battlefields. But the burden of leadership weighs heavily on her, and the haunting echoes of Darkness whisper in her mind, threatening to erode the humanity she fights to protect.</p> <p>As Theresa battles across the galaxy, her power grows, but so does the risk of losing herself. Her journey becomes a desperate struggle not just to protect the faint light of hope but to ensure that her vengeance does not consume the very thing she seeks to save. <span class="highlight">The Dark Saint</span> is a tale of sacrifice, resilience, and the weight of legacy—a story that reminds us that even in the deepest shadow, the faintest spark can light the way.</p> <p><span class="highlight">Theresa’s Powers:</span></p> <ul> <li><span class="highlight">Reforged Scythe:</span> Her weapon, infused with the lingering energy of Darkness, channels devastating attacks that can cleave through both physical and metaphysical enemies. Each strike releases rippling shockwaves of despair that weaken her foes’ resolve.</li> <li><span class="highlight">Aura of Reckoning:</span> Theresa’s presence exudes an oppressive aura of despair and sorrow, sapping the willpower of her enemies and reducing their ability to fight effectively. Allies within her reach, however, are emboldened by her unyielding resolve.</li> <li><span class="highlight">Shattered Echo:</span> Drawing on the essence of Darkness, Theresa can summon spectral shadows of her fallen comrades to fight alongside her. These phantoms strike terror into her enemies and serve as reminders of the lives lost to the war.</li> <li><span class="highlight">Fury Unleashed:</span> In moments of overwhelming emotion, Theresa can unleash a wave of raw energy, devastating everything in her path. This ability leaves her drained, both physically and emotionally, and risks further eroding her humanity.</li> <li><span class="highlight">Last Light:</span> At great personal cost, Theresa can channel her energy to heal allies and fortify their strength. This power is a reflection of the nurturing leader she once was but requires her to sacrifice part of her own vitality.</li> </ul> <p><span class="highlight">Theresa, The Dark Saint</span>, is a figure of sorrow and strength, her powers embodying the duality of grief and hope. As she carves a path of vengeance across the galaxy, she must grapple with the weight of her choices and the legacy she will leave behind. Her story is one of sacrifice and resilience, a reminder that even in the face of overwhelming despair, the faintest spark can ignite the will to endure—and to fight for a better tomorrow.</p>
