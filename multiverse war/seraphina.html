               <p><span class="highlight">Seraphina</span>, the embodiment of destruction and renewal, wields the fearsome power of Blood Dominion—a force that transforms life itself into a weapon of war. With it, she sculpts towering constructs of blood, their forms as fluid as her will and as unrelenting as her resolve. On the battlefield, she is an unstoppable tempest, absorbing the strength of her enemies and leaving a trail of devastation in her wake. Yet, beneath her imposing exterior lies a heart weighed down by guilt. Every victory carved from the life force of others haunts her, forcing her to question whether she is a savior or a harbinger of ruin.</p> <p>Her power demands a heavy price, and her relationships with the <span class="highlight">Original Seven</span> reflect the tension of her inner struggles. Seraphina’s blunt, confrontational nature often puts her at odds with <span class="highlight">Selena</span>, whose measured approach to conflict feels maddeningly slow. Their arguments are a clash of ideologies—instinct versus strategy—but their trust in battle is unbreakable. Together, their synergy turns the tide of wars, their differences dissolving in the crucible of combat.</p> <p>With <span class="highlight">Lilith</span>, Seraphina’s frustration is more personal. Lilith’s unyielding compassion feels alien, even indulgent, to a warrior who has sacrificed so much to endure. Yet, Lilith’s quiet strength and ability to maintain her humanity in the chaos of war earn Seraphina’s reluctant admiration. It is a courage Seraphina envies but fears she can never reclaim.</p> <p><span class="highlight">Arcana</span> represents a mirror Seraphina wishes she could shatter. The cold, calculated pragmatism that defines Arcana’s approach to war is a chilling echo of Seraphina’s own doubts—the part of her that fears she has become nothing more than a weapon. Their exchanges are charged with tension, both women unafraid to challenge the other’s perspective. And yet, Seraphina respects Arcana’s brilliance, even as it forces her to confront uncomfortable truths about the cost of survival.</p> <p>Then there is <span class="highlight">Veronica</span>, the youngest among them. Unlike her older counterparts, Veronica embraces the full spectrum of emotion, refusing to close herself off to pain or joy. To Seraphina, this openness is both maddening and inspiring—a reminder of what she has lost in the pursuit of power. Beneath her blunt exterior, Seraphina holds a quiet admiration for Veronica’s resilience, a strength she fears she can never match.</p> <p>Seraphina’s powers are both her salvation and her torment:</p> <ul> <li><span class="highlight">Blood Sculpting</span>: She manipulates blood with terrifying precision, forging weapons, constructs, and defenses that overwhelm her enemies with their unyielding force.</li> <li><span class="highlight">Sanguine Replenishment</span>: By drawing blood from her foes, Seraphina heals her own wounds and fuels her strength, making her nearly invincible in prolonged battles.</li> <li><span class="highlight">Crimson Maelstrom</span>: Unleashing a torrent of whirling blood, Seraphina devastates entire battlefields, the raw energy tearing through anything in its path.</li> <li><span class="highlight">Vital Bond</span>: Seraphina can siphon the life force of others, strengthening her allies or crippling her enemies, though the act leaves her with a lingering sense of their pain and loss.</li> <li><span class="highlight">Bloodbound Constructs</span>: Towering avatars of blood, imbued with a fragment of Seraphina’s essence, fight with relentless precision and ferocity.</li> </ul> <p>Each use of her abilities takes a toll—not on her body, but on her soul. The more she leans into her powers, the further she feels herself slipping from the woman she once was, the one who fought to protect life rather than command it. Seraphina’s story is one of contradictions: a warrior who saves lives by taking them, a protector who wrestles with the weight of her own destruction. As the shadow of <span class="highlight">Persephone Prime</span> threatens to engulf the multiverse, Seraphina faces an impossible choice. Will she continue to wield her power at the cost of her humanity, or will she find a way to fight without losing herself entirely?</p> <p>In the end, Seraphina is not defined by the blood she commands, but by the courage it takes to bear its weight. Her struggle is a testament to the cost of power—and the hope of redemption in the face of unimaginable loss.</p>
